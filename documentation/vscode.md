# VS Code
VS Code can provide a Vim-like experience with extensions. Multiple are available.
* [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
* [VSCode Neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim)
There are multiple extensions for C# support.

## Pros
* Available on all OSs
* Full IDE experience
* Strong set of extensions for C# support. Though the need for C# Dev Kit suggests it lags behind Visual Studio on features.
## VsCodeVim
### Shortcomings
* Not a full Vim experience:
  * `:normal` is not supported.
* Serious bugs
  *  [Undo adds newlines](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/4176)
## VSode Neovim
### Shortcomings
TODO haven't tried. Sounds promising as it uses NeoVim for normal mode. May miss insert mode for some features as that's fully on VsCode.
