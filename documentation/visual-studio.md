# Visual Studio
Visual Studio can give a Vim-like experience with the addition of the [VsVim](https://github.com/VsVim/VsVim) extension.
## Shortcomings
* Only available on Windows
* Not a full Vim experience (TODO it's been so long since I've used this I forget specific shortcomings)
## Pros
* Full IDE experience
* .NET and C# support built-in and up to date.
